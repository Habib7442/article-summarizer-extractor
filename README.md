This project was inspired by the YouTube video tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery), where I learned valuable insights into using Rapid API, Fetching Data using Redux toolkit.

You can watch the YouTube video [here](https://youtu.be/A6g8xc0MoiY?si=1cOkgVzBsNluyRiq) to get a better understanding of the concepts used in this project.

This project utilizes the [RapidAPI](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWVTR19FbmdFRXk1SGpCa1JhQy1xUWtOZ3R1QXxBQ3Jtc0tsVEp4NXhYS2VMVTRKYVNaNXByX0xveHl0NXdOQzhCcjQ0X05ZM3lGblJSWmQ0OHF6WXA0VjZ0VzNIRzFFRV9SWktYNXZhU1IxSXp3VmlZS2szZV95WUlUNE1Mdld0WldRSmgzc3AtTFhvbVlPMGR5dw&q=https%3A%2F%2Frapidapi.com%2Frestyler%2Fapi%2Farticle-extractor-and-summarizer%3Futm_source%3Dyoutube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DDevRel&v=A6g8xc0MoiY) platform to access external data sources and APIs. RapidAPI simplifies the process of integrating third-party services, making it an essential part of this project's functionality.
